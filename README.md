# Generating Images with TryLeap.ai

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use TryLeap.ai's API to generate realistic images from textual prompts using machine learning.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you will need to have an API key for TryLeap.ai. You can sign up for a free account and get an API key [here](https://tryleap.ai/). Once you have an API key, you will need to replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` string in the script with your actual API key.

You will also need to have the `requests` and `json` Python modules installed. You can install these modules using pip by running:

```
pip install requests
```

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it with Python:

```
python generate_images.py
```

The script will perform the following steps:

1. Create a custom model on TryLeap.ai's platform and upload sample images to it.
2. Fine-tune the model on the uploaded sample images.
3. Use the fine-tuned model to generate an image based on a textual prompt.

The generated image will be output to the console in the form of a URL.

## Modifying the Script

If you want to generate images based on a different prompt, you can modify the `generate_image` function in the script. This function takes two arguments: the `model_id` of the model to use, and the `prompt` text. You can change the `prompt` text to any text that you want to generate an image for.
